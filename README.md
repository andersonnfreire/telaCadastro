# Registration Screen

The registration screen was implemented in the pascal object (delphi) which has the following requirements:

 - When entering the components it must change color. And when you leave it must return to its original color.
 - At the end of the registration you must have a memo and button. By clicking on the button you must write a running text
 containing the student's registration data.
 - In another button you must have the option to create a file with the student's name, containing the memo data.
 - Place the application screen to be centered, remove the maximize, minimize and close buttons (0.5 Point).
 - Change the tab to enter to move between fields and hit the sequence.
 - Place a close button on the application.
